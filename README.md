Remote sensing is a modern technique for capturing images of Earth without direct contact, using
drones, aircraft, and satellites. It enables the collection of data across different wavelengths,
helping to identify vegetation areas, water zones, and more. Such tools are invaluable for informed
environmental decision-making.

As a conclusion, This study demonstrates the effectiveness of remote sensing techniques, particularly using Sentinel-
2 images, for monitoring vegetation through NDVI analysis. Weather conditions, such as cloud
cover, can significantly impact data accuracy, highlighting the importance of image preprocessing
methods like cloud masking for reliable environmental analysis.
